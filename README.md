## Project Summary
With March Madness around the corner, a lot of excitment come from being able to predict some possible matchups, upsets and even who is going to win it all. While most fans rely heavily on their emotions and fanatism to predict certain outcomes, this project uses machine learning to assist in predicting the 2023 bracket. To find out the  model's prediction, follow this instructions below.

## Getting started
To use this model, download the repo how you prefer, run the jupyter notebook file if you want to use the local data. The html file is used to diplay the results.
